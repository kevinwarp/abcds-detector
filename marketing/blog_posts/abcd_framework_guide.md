## Draft

YouTube's ABCD framework is one of the best-kept secrets in digital advertising. Backed by Google's own research across thousands of video ads, it outlines the creative principles that drive measurable performance — and ads that follow it consistently see 30%+ higher ad recall and conversion rates.

Yet most advertisers have never heard of it. And even those who have rarely apply it systematically.

In this post, I'll break down each component of the ABCD framework, explain why it matters, and show you how to automate the entire evaluation process using AI.

### What Is the ABCD Framework?

ABCD stands for **Attract, Brand, Connect, Direct** — four pillars that define what makes a video ad effective on YouTube.

### A — Attract: Hook Viewers Immediately

You have ~5 seconds before viewers hit "Skip." The Attract dimension ensures your ad grabs attention instantly.

**Key features:**
- **Dynamic Start** — First shot change within 3 seconds (no slow fades or static openings)
- **Quick Pacing** — 5+ shot changes in any 5-second window
- **Supers** — On-screen text overlays (titles, callouts, captions)
- **Supers with Audio** — Text reinforced by matching spoken audio
- **Audio Early** — Speech or narration begins within first 5 seconds

**Why it matters:** YouTube's research shows ads with a strong opening hook see significantly higher view-through rates.

### B — Brand: Make It Unmistakable

Viewers should know who's talking to them — early and often.

**Key features:**
- **Brand Visuals** — Logo or brand name visible on screen
- **Brand Visuals (First 5s)** — Logo visible within first 5 seconds
- **Brand Mention (Speech)** — Brand name spoken aloud
- **Brand Mention (Speech) (First 5s)** — Brand spoken within first 5 seconds

**Why it matters:** Ads that show or say the brand in the first 5 seconds drive 2-3x higher ad recall.

### C — Connect: Create Emotional Resonance

Human presence creates emotional connection. Product visibility reinforces the message.

**Key features:**
- **Presence of People** — People appear anywhere in the video
- **Visible Face (First 5s)** — A human face within the first 5 seconds
- **Visible Face (Close Up)** — Close-up of a face at any point
- **Product Visuals** — Product shown on screen
- **Product Mention (Speech/Text)** — Product referenced verbally or in text

**Why it matters:** Ads featuring people — especially faces — generate stronger emotional engagement and purchase intent.

### D — Direct: Tell Viewers What to Do

A clear call-to-action converts passive viewers into customers.

**Key features:**
- **Call to Action (Speech)** — Spoken directive ("Shop now," "Learn more")
- **Call to Action (Text)** — Text overlay with CTA

**Why it matters:** Ads with explicit CTAs see measurably higher click-through and conversion rates.

### The Problem: Manual Review Doesn't Scale

Here's the challenge: evaluating even one video against all 23+ ABCD features takes 30-60 minutes of careful manual review. Multiply that by 50 or 100 ads, and you need a dedicated team.

And manual reviews are inconsistent — two reviewers will often disagree on whether a feature is present.

### The Solution: Automate with AI

This is exactly why I built **Creative Reviewer** — an open-source tool that uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro and Video Intelligence API to automate the entire ABCD evaluation.

**How it works:**
1. Upload a video or paste a YouTube URL
2. AI evaluates all 23+ features using a hybrid approach (structured annotations + LLM reasoning)
3. Each feature gets pass/fail, confidence score, evidence, and recommendations
4. Get a full PDF report in ~2 minutes

**Beyond ABCD:** It also predicts CPA risk, ROAS potential, creative fatigue, and detects persuasion tactics.

### Key Takeaways

1. **ABCD isn't optional** — It's the proven playbook for YouTube ad performance
2. **Most ads fail at Attract** — The first 5 seconds are make-or-break
3. **Brand early, brand often** — Showing brand in the first 5 seconds = 2-3x recall
4. **Faces drive connection** — Human presence creates emotional resonance
5. **Always include a CTA** — Never leave viewers guessing
6. **Automate the review** — Manual evaluation doesn't scale; AI can do it in minutes
