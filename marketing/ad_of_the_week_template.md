## Ad Selection Ideas

Rotate across categories to keep the audience broad:

- **Super Bowl ads** (January-February — peak interest)
- **Product launch ads** (Apple, Samsung, Tesla, etc.)
- **DTC brand ads** (high engagement from agency/brand audience)
- **Viral campaigns** (trending ads people are already talking about)
- **Industry-specific** (SaaS, CPG, auto, finance — rotate)
- **Before/after** — Score an old ad and its refreshed version
- **Competitor showdown** — Score two competing brands' ads side-by-side

---

## Tips

- **Tag the brand and agency** — They often engage or reshare, dramatically increasing reach
- **Lead with the score** — A specific number (67%, 84%) is more compelling than "good" or "bad"
- **Highlight surprises** — "Even a $7M Super Bowl ad missed this basic feature" gets more engagement than praise
- **Include screenshots** — Visual posts get 2-3x more engagement on LinkedIn
- **Post consistently** — Same day/time each week builds audience expectation
- **Rotate industries** — Don't just analyze one category; variety attracts a broader audience
