## Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**

I built an open-source AI that scores video ads against YouTube's ABCD framework in 2 minutes.

It found that 73% of the ads I tested fail at least one critical "Attract" feature.

Here's what it does 🧵

**Tweet 2 (The Problem)**

Manual creative review is broken:

→ One ad takes 30-60 min to score by hand
→ Reviewers disagree with each other
→ Brands launch ads without knowing if they follow best practices
→ Agencies can't scale QA across 100+ creatives

---

**Tweet 3 (The Solution)**

Creative Reviewer automates the entire process:

Upload a video → AI analyzes 23+ features → Get a detailed report

It uses Gemini 2.5 Pro for subjective analysis and Video Intelligence API for objective metrics.

Combined accuracy: 90-95% vs human experts.

**Tweet 4 (ABCD Framework)**

What does it evaluate?

🅰️ Attract — Hook, pacing, dynamic start, supers
🅱️ Brand — Logo visibility, brand mentions (visual + audio)
🅲️ Connect — People, faces, product presence
🅳️ Direct — CTA (spoken + text)

Each feature gets: pass/fail, confidence score, evidence, and recommendations.

**Tweet 5 (Beyond ABCD)**

But it goes beyond ABCD compliance:

📊 Performance Score (0-100)
⚠️ CPA Risk prediction
💰 ROAS Tier estimate
🔄 Creative Fatigue detection
🎯 Funnel Strength (TOF/MOF/BOF)
🧠 Persuasion tactics (7 Cialdini principles)
📖 Narrative structure analysis

---

**Tweet 6 (Speed + Cost)**

Performance:

⚡ 30s video → ~2 min analysis
⚡ 60s video → ~5 min analysis
💰 Cost: $0.10-$0.30 per video
📄 Output: JSON, HTML, or PDF report

That's 100x faster than manual review.

**Tweet 7 (Demo / Screenshot)**

Here's what the output looks like:
