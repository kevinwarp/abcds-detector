## Post Copy

I built an AI that reviews video ads in 2 minutes.

Here's why:

Last year I watched a team spend 3 hours manually scoring a single video ad against YouTube's ABCD framework.

Checklist in one hand. Stopwatch in the other. Rewinding the same 5 seconds over and over to count shot changes.

For ONE video.

And they had 47 more to review.

That's when I thought: what if AI could do this instantly?

So I built Creative Reviewer.

It uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro + Video Intelligence API to automatically score video ads across 23+ creative best practices:

→ Does the ad hook viewers in the first 5 seconds?
→ Is the brand visible early enough?
→ Are there people and faces on screen?
→ Is there a clear call-to-action?
→ How strong is the persuasion strategy?

It goes beyond compliance scoring with performance predictions:
• CPA Risk assessment
• ROAS potential tier
• Creative fatigue detection
• Funnel strength analysis (TOF/MOF/BOF)

The results?
⚡ 30-second video analyzed in ~2 minutes
🎯 90-95% accuracy vs. human experts
💰 $0.10-$0.30 per video

And it's completely open source.

Upload a video, get a full PDF report with confidence scores, evidence, and actionable recommendations for every feature.

If you're an agency, brand, or media buyer spending hours on creative QA — this might save you weeks.

## Engagement Strategy

1. **Before posting:** DM 5-10 marketing connections asking them to engage early (comment/like within first hour)
2. **First hour:** Reply to every comment immediately — LinkedIn's algorithm rewards early engagement
3. **Tag:** Tag 2-3 people in the post who would genuinely find this useful (don't spam-tag)
4. **Follow-up:** 24 hours later, post a comment with a specific result ("Just ran a Super Bowl ad through it — scored 67%. Here's what it missed...")
