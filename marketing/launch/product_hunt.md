## Maker Comment (Post Immediately After Launch)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Kevin, and I built Creative Reviewer to solve a problem I kept running into: manually reviewing video ads against YouTube's ABCD framework is painfully slow and inconsistent.

**The problem:** A single video takes 30-60 minutes to manually score against 23+ best practices. Scale that to dozens or hundreds of ads and it becomes a full-time job.

**The solution:** Creative Reviewer uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro and Video Intelligence API to automate the entire review. Upload a video, and in ~2 minutes you get:

- Pass/fail for each ABCD feature with confidence scores
- Performance predictions (CPA risk, ROAS tier, creative fatigue)
- Persuasion tactic detection (7 Cialdini principles)
- Scene-by-scene analysis with keyframes
- A downloadable PDF report

**Who it's for:**
- Agencies doing creative QA at scale
- Brands wanting to audit their video libraries
- Media buyers who want to predict creative performance before spending
- Anyone running YouTube ads

It's 100% open source and self-hosted in your own GCP project, so your videos stay private.

Would love your feedback — what features would make this more useful for your workflow?
